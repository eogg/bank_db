# CODE2COLLEGE ELITE102 BANK DATABASE

#### The entirety of my project is stored here, along with my database with two tables.
The program allows for two types of accounts to be made, an Admin account and a User account. 
Admins can modify their own account along with any user account, as long as they provide the user ID and PIN number.

No Unit Tests were used in the making of this program, since there were not really any return statements, I instead called each function after creation, and tested it to it's limits with the inputs, making sure no errors would spew out in case the user didn't follow directions.

#### The project spans over 4 files, with the one that runs everything being UI.py. 
#### ui_functions.py holds all of the ui printing, and selections. 
#### database_functions holds all functions needed to update/create accounts in MySQL. 
#### passwordIn.py holds the database password.

Made using Python 3.11.3
